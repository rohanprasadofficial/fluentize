## Figma Code Generator

Hey , thanks for checking out our project. We're are here to make developers , designers , PM & EM lives easier. 

The idea is to generate fluent code right from the figma by right clicking and export the code. 


### Setup Guide 

Clone it into your local system 

- Run yarn to install dependencies.
- Run yarn build:watch to start webpack in watch mode.
- Open Figma -> Plugins -> Development -> Import plugin from manifest... and choose manifest.json file from this repo.
- Left click on figma and select plugin , you will find this name , and run the plugin , donneeeeeeeeee !


⭐ To change the UI of your plugin (the react code), start editing App.tsx

⭐ To interact with the Figma API edit controller.ts 


Happy Hacking !
